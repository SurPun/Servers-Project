# Week 1: Server Project (F&C)

### By: Sumithra, Joe, Yassien & Suraj
A website that allows users to make comments and read the comments of other users. This project is created with node.js

Live page hosted on [Heroku](https://food-opinion.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.  

This uses the `nodemon` library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

## Test

- [x] Test 3 Tests for home route responds to post requests.

## Users Stories

- [x] As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them.

- [x] As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted.

## Stretch

- [x] As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Deployed to Heroku
- [x] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [x] No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- [x] No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- [x] All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- [x] Tests for each server route
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
